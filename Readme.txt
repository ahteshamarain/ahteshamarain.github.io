A streaming website is an online platform that uses internet technology to deliver audio and video content to users
in real-time. Instead of downloading the entire file, users can start watching or listening almost instantly, making
it a convenient way to access entertainment, live events, and other media without the need for large downloads. 
Popular streaming websites offer a wide range of content, from movies and TV shows to music, sports events, and more. 
Subscription-based services and ad-supported models are common in the streaming industry.
